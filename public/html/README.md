# HTML Snippets Directory

Store reusable HTML components and snippets here.

## Important MFL Restrictions

Remember that MFL does NOT allow these tags:
- `<html>` and `</html>`
- `<body>` and `</body>`  
- `<textarea>` and `</textarea>`

All snippets should be valid HTML fragments without these tags.

## Usage in MFL

Copy snippet content and paste into MFL's Home Page Messages (1-20).

## Organization

Consider organizing snippets by:
- Component type (headers, footers, sidebars, etc.)
- League-specific vs. shared
- Functionality (standings tables, recent activity, etc.)

## Best Practices

- Keep snippets modular and self-contained
- Comment your code for future reference
- Test snippets before deploying to live leagues
- Use semantic HTML for better accessibility
